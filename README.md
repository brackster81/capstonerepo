This is a fitness website project. The goal is to help people meet their fitness needs.

Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event):

	- Countdown to the end of the year near the bottom of index.html,   	  calculated in countdown.js

Use a regular expression to validate user input and either prevent the invalid input or inform the user about it (in all cases prevent invalid input from being stored or saved).

	- Password requirements must be met on registrationform.html before 
	  being able to submit form to profile.html, otherwise user gets and   	  error message, and this is found in script.js 

Create a function that accepts two or more input parameters and returns a value that is calculated or determined by the inputs.  Basic math functions donâ€™t count (e.g. addition, etc).

	- Body Mass Index (BMI) calculated in profil.js and displayed in 	  profile.html
	

- Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app.

	- ExerciseDB API retrieved in exercises.js and displayed in drop-	  down box in exercises.html
